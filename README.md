# Java Game Box: Galaga
**Worked during February 2020**

First project for the CIIC 4010: Advanced Programming class (object oriented programming in Java).

The objective of this project was to develop Java Game Box: Galaga a simplified version of the game of the century Galaga. This project was worked in teams of two students. The project helped develop technical skills such as:

 - reading and understanding Java code
 - creating classes and methods
 - implementing these in Java

Originally, a base-unfinished code was given, with the purpose for it to be completed to meet with project specs and requirements. This project was worked by [sebastian-maldonado4](https://github.com/sebastian-maldonado4) and [xavierRosado](https://github.com/xavierRosado).
